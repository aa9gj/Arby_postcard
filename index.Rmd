My career has been driven by a single principle: ensuring results are repeatable, defensible, and built on a foundation of integrity. For over five years as a computational biologist, I applied that principle to scientific discovery; today, I apply it to Quality Assurance.

In my former roles at Colgate-Palmolive and the University of Virginia, I built automated systems to manage and analyze complex biological data. The work demanded rigorous version control, adherence to established protocols, and a constant focus on creating structured, reviewable evidence from raw data. This experience in an SOP-driven R&D environment is the foundation of my compliance-focused mindset.

Now, as a QA professional and Six Sigma Yellow Belt (CSSGB in progress), I'm focused on what I care about most: audit readiness, data integrity (ALCOA+), and robust quality systems. I use my background in Biomedical Data Science to not only follow processes, but to help validate and improve them.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m into soccer, cooking, and translating complex ideas for non-specialists.
