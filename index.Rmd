Iâ€™m a PhD candidate, bioinformatician and data scientist at The University of Virginia School of Medicine. My research focuses on identifying theraputic targets for ostoeoporosis using systems genetics. I am currently integrating genome-wide association studies, splice quantitative trait loci, long-read RNA sequencing, and proteomics to identify novel isoforms as candidate causal mediators of disease. I love talking about genomics, bioinformatics, soccer, and cooking.
