I'm a computational biologist currently working at Colgate-Palmolive, where I lead multi-omics and clinical biomarker projects to support precision health and translational research.

Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of Virginia in the Center for Public Health Genomics, where I focused on identifying therapeutic targets for osteoporosis using systems genetics and integrative multi-omics (including GWAS, sQTL, eQTL, long-read RNA-seq, scRNAseq, and proteomics).

I specialize in turning messy biological data into structured, reproducible insights. I’m now expanding into clinical trial operations and regulated project delivery in the life sciences industry.

Outside of work, I’m into soccer, cooking, and translating genomics for non-specialists.
